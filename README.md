# LeetCode-Solutions

This repository consists of problems I have solved. Most of them are my solutions from Leetcode, but there are also problems I have solved from elsewhere or in competitions. There are also some special problems classified into folders. The folder names should be self-explanatory. All the solutions are in Python. I have added notes to some problems (especially Blind75 problems) here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10rNXBKSpbiYSiZS54SroJbwYDmoxebuExDS6trZBrU0/edit#gid=0.

I hope it helps!
